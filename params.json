{"name":"Simon-clone-for-arduino","body":"# Summary\r\n\r\nThis is the C++ code for an Arduino project to build a clone of the classic electronic game \"Simon,\" using LEDs and a speaker to provide audiovisual feedback, and using a Super Famicom controller for user input.\r\n\r\nFor the Super Famicom controller input, I'm using the excellent SNESpad library made by [Rob Duarte](http://code.google.com/p/nespad/). Thanks, Rob!!\r\n\r\nYou can watch a video of an early version of the hardware [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHPPuXDk-Dk).\r\n\r\n# Credits\r\n\r\nThis application was programmed by [Nat Guy](http://www.natguy.net).","tagline":"This is a clone of the classic electronic game \"Simon\" for Arduino, using a Super Famicom controller for input.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
