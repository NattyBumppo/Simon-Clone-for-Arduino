# Summary

This is the C++ code for an Arduino project to build a clone of the classic electronic game "Simon," using LEDs and a speaker to provide audiovisual feedback, and using a Super Famicom controller for user input.

For the Super Famicom controller input, I'm using the excellent SNESpad library made by [Rob Duarte](http://code.google.com/p/nespad/). Thanks, Rob!!

You can watch a video of an early version of the hardware [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kHPPuXDk-Dk).
